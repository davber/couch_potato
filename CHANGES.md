## Changes

### 0.4.0 - fork-specific!
* type field of documents now configurable, by using CouchPotato.type_field (davber)
* the mapping from class to design document name is now configurable, by using `CouchPotato.design_name_fun`, which is supposed to be a Proc (davber)
* one can disable automatic view creation, by setting `CouchPotato::bypass_view_creation` to `true`; this enables one to use views created by other means, such as via CouchApp (davber)

* couch potato objects now behave correctly when used as keys in Hashes (langalex)

* support yielding to blocks on #initialize (martinrehfeld)
* support for negative numbers in Fixnum/Float properties (langalex)

### 0.3.1
